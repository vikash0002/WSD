<body>

Provides sample graph code that may be of interest. In particular,
<ul>
<li><tt>{@link samples.graph.SimpleGraphDraw SimpleGraphDraw}</tt> 
shows the simplest way to put a graph into a visualization and 
have something come up.
</li>
<li><tt>
{@link samples.graph.ClusteringDemo ClusteringDemo}</tt>
shows off a combination of 
<tt>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.graph.filters.Filter Filter}</tt>s
 and 
 <tt>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.algorithms.cluster.EdgeBetweennessClusterer EdgeBetweennessClusterer}</tt>, 
 rendererd with 
 <tt>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.graphdraw.VertexColorFunction VertexColorFunction}</tt>s, 
 <tt>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.graphdraw.EdgeColorFunction EdgeColorFunction}</tt>s, 
 and an <tt>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.FRLayout FRLayout}</tt>.
</li>
<li><tt>{@link samples.graph.RankingDemo RankingDemo}<tt> shows a different way of putting
together algorithmically-derived information with a custom 
<tt>Renderer</tt>,
called the
<tt>{@link samples.graph.BasicRenderer BasicRenderer}</tt>, which varies the node size.</li>
</ul>
Source code for the samples is provided in the JUNG distribution.
