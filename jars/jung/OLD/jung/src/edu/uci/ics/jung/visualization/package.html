Provides a visualization mechanism for drawing and rendering <tt>Graph</tt>s. Current default implementation is for Swing, but most subsystems are extensible for other toolkits.
<p>
In general, a visualization is accomplished with
<ul>
<li>a (Swing) Component, into which the data is rendered. This implementation uses a <code>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.VisualizationViewer VisualizationViewer}</code></li>
<li>a <code>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.Renderer Renderer}</code>, which determines how specific Vertices are drawn on screen.
<li>a <code>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.Layout Layout}</code>, which determines where Vertices are drawn on screen.</li>
</ul>
Thus, by selecting one of each of these three, it is possible to coordinate drawing. The default implementation traverses the <code>Visualizer</code>, asking it for locations of vertices, and then paints them individually with the <code>Renderer</code> inside the Swing component. In addition, the <code>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.GraphDraw GraphDraw}</code> infrastructure simplifies many of these transformations by packaging the <tt>VisualizationViewer</tt>, the <tt>Renderer</tt>, and the <tt>Visualizer</tt> together. Users may then substitute out parts as it is appropriate. (Sample code is available in the <tt>GraphDraw</tt> documentation.)
<p>
The current implementation supports only 2-D layout algorithms (because it doesn't contain code to transform 3D coordinates
to 2D) and only visualizes <tt>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.graph.Graph Graph}</tt>s (as opposed to the more general <tt>ArchetypeGraph</tt>s.)
<p>
In order to set up fading effects when vertices are filtered
out and filtered in, see the notes at 
<code>{@link edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.FadingVertexLayout FadingVertexLayout}</code>.
