<p>A <code>Predicate</code> tests whether an <code>Object</code> satisfies a specific 
implementation-defined property.  Predicates may be logically combined using
such Jakarta-defined predicates as <code>AndPredicate</code> (which returns
true if all input predicates return true).
JUNG uses <code>Predicates</code> (found in the <code>graph.predicates</code>
package) for the following tasks:
<ul>
<li/>defining constraints on edges and vertices added to a graph (=> graphs
that only allow vertices with (one of) a (set of) specified decoration(s), 
or that only allow directed edges)
<li/>defining/creating edge and vertex subsets (create a subset of all
vertices with label "student")
<li/>general testing for properties of edges, vertices, and graphs (is this
graph connected?)
</ul> 
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Some predicates are unsuitable for use as constraints
(and some predicates are <i>only</i> suitable for use as constraints).
We have tried to make these distinctions clear in the documentation for
each predicate.  Users are advised to read the documentation for 
a predicate before using it.  Some general rules for which predicates are
appropriate in different circumstances:
<ul>
<li/>Vertex constraints should be (logical combinations of) 
<code>VertexPredicate</code>.
<li/>Edge constraints should be (logical combinations of) 
<code>EdgePredicate</code>.
<li/><code>GraphPredicates</code> are not appropriate for use as 
vertex or edge constraints, or for defining vertex/edge subsets.
<li/>Some predicates specify that they are intended for use only on
orphaned vertices/edges (those that have not yet been added to a graph).
These are only suitable for use as constraints.
<li/>Predicates that only check for non-structural attributes (e.g.,
decorations or other metadata) of vertices or edges are suitable for 
general use (constraint definition, subset specification, etc.).
<ul>
<li/>However, constraints and subset specifications are only checked 
<i>once</i>: when the element is added to the graph.  If a graph 
element's attribute is mutable, and changes after it is added to a graph 
(or a cached subset managed by <code>SubsetManager</code>) such that it no longer 
passes a constraint (belongs in a subset), JUNG will not 
throw an exception, nor will it automatically remove the graph element
from the graph (subset).
<li/>Users who wish to update their graphs/subsets in response to 
such changes may wish to create a listener that is notified of 
changes to relevant attributes.
</ul>
<li/>Only vertex constraints are checked when a vertex is added, 
and only edge constraints are checked when an edge is added.
Therefore, predicates that check for structural properties (for example,
the degree of a vertex) are not suitable for use as constraints.
</ul>
</p>

<p>JUNG <code>Predicates</code> that do not take constructor arguments are 
accessed via a static <code>getInstance</code> call; other <code>Predicates</code>
are created with the usual constructor call.  </p>
