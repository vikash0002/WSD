<p>Provides a set of algorithms for computing the importance of each node (or edge)
in a graph relative to all others (or, for the algorithms that inherit from 
<code>RelativeAuthorityRanker</code>, relative to a specified subset of elements).
</p>

<p>Currently, all the ranking (authority) algorithms derive from <code>AbstractRanker</code>.
A typical use of one of these algorithms follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
AbstractRanker ranker = new DegreeDistributionRanker(graph, true);
ranker.evaluate();
List rankingList = ranker.getRankings();
</pre>
</blockquote>

The first command creates the ranking algorithm instance for the specified graph, with 
the <code>true</code> flag indicating that the algorithm is to rank nodes according to their
indegree (as opposed to their outdegree).  The second command causes the ranks to be 
calculated, and the final command retrieves the calculated ranks.  The ranks may also be 
retrieved for a specific elements <code>e</code> by calling <code>getRankScore(e)</code>
(although see below).
</p>

<p>In the process of calculating the ranks for each element, the elements' 
<code>UserData</code> repositories are decorated with their rank score, with a user-specified
key or with a default key based on the class.  By default, these 
decorations are removed when the evaluation step has completed, and the user only has access
to the list of rankings.  If you wish to be able to fetch individual scores using 
<code>getRankScore</code>, you must call 

<blockquote>
<pre>
ranker.setRemoveRankScoresOnFinalize(false);
</pre>
</blockquote>

before calling <code>evaluate()</code>.</p>

<p>Some of these algorithms normalize the rank scores that they calculate (so that the 
scores for all edges, or all vertices, will sum to 1), but some do 
not; check the documentation for each algorithm for details.
