<body>

These are additional layouts contributed by various users. 
We make these available as a service to the JUNG community; however,
we have not tested them as thoroughly as some of our other code.
<p>
<ul>
<li>KKLayout implements the beautiful Kamada-Kawai layout; this is the most elegant layout algorithm we have in JUNG (although it takes a little longer to actually accomplish the layout).
<li>DAGLayout is a variant of the SpringLayout that takes a DAG (Directed, Acyclic Graph) and lays it out, ensuring that it respects the relative order of vertices
<li>CircleLayout is a simple layout that places nodes in random order around a circle.
</ul>
Note that neither CircleLayout nor KKLayout respond to filter calls correctly; note further that KKLayout is known to crash when the program changes TO it from some other layout. (There's no problem if the GraphDraw is created with the Layout, though).
